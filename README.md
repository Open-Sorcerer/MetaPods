**MetaPods is a mobile app to share images,videos and other heavy files with your friends over a decentralized network.** We are using a **Polygon Smart contract** to make sure about the logic and IPFS as the storage protocol. 

You can create **Pods** where you can add your friends, you need to **add wallet addresses or ENS domains**, all the participants of the pods are called podmates. You add the images to the Pod by choosing from your local storage and those images are **hosted over IPFS**. All the podmates can view the images shared in the Pod.   

You can click pictures and **mint them as NFTs instantly** on the go !! Just open the Instant Minter, click a picture or choose from gallery and the transaction gets created !!
