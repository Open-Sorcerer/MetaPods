# Pods

Built on top of [React Native Boilerplate](https://github.com/ethereum-boilerplate/ethereum-react-native-boilerplate) 

Pods is a mobile app to share images,videos and other heavy files with your friends over a decentralized network. We are using a Polygon Smart contract to make sure about the logic and IPFS as the storage protocol. 

You can create Pods where you can add your friends, you need to add wallet addresses or ENS domains, all the participants of the pods are called podmates. You add the images to the Pod by choosing from your local storage and those images are hosted over IPFS. All the podmates can view the images shared in the Pod.
